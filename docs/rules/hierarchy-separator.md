# Deprecated hierarchy separator (hierarchy-separator)

<!-- RULE-CATEGORIES:START -->

**Included in these configurations**: <ul><li>csf</li><li>recommended</li></ul>

<!-- RULE-CATEGORIES:END -->

## Rule Details

Since Storybook 6.0, the ability to specify the hierarchy separators (how you control the grouping of story kinds in the sidebar) was removed. There is now a single separator `/`, which cannot be configured. If you are using `|` or `.` as a separator, you should change all of them to `/`.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
export default {
  title: 'Components|Forms/Input',
  component: Input,
}
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
export default {
  title: 'Components/Forms/Input',
  component: Input,
}
```
