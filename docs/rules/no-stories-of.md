# storiesOf is deprecated and should not be used (no-stories-of)

<!-- RULE-CATEGORIES:START -->

**Included in these configurations**: <ul><li>csf-strict</li></ul>

<!-- RULE-CATEGORIES:END -->

## Rule Details

Since Storybook 5.2, the [CSF format](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) was introduced and the `storiesOf` API has been deprecated.

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
import { storiesOf } from '@storybook/react'
import Button from '../components/Button'

storiesOf('Button', module).add('primary', () => <Button primary />)
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
import Button from '../components/Button';

export default = {
  component: Button
}

export const Primary = () => <Button primary />
```

```js
import Button from '../components/Button';

export default = {
  component: Button
}

export const Primary = {
  args: {
    primary: true
  }
}
```
